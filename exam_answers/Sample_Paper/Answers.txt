QUESTION 1:
Let X and Y be independent random variables.
Takes values in the set {1,2,3}.
Let V = 2X + 2Y.
Let W = X - Y.


(a)
Assume P(X = x) and P(Y = y) are non-zero for any x,y elements of {1,2,3}.
Can V and W be independent?

Independence: P(V=v âˆ© W=w) = P(V=v)P(W=w)

V = v = 10 when (X=2, Y=3) and (X=3, Y=2)
(i.e.) P(V=10) = P(X=2 and Y=3) + P(X=3 and Y=2)

W = w = 0 then X-Y = 0 when X=Y.
(i.e.) P(W=0) = P(X=1 and Y=1) + 
				P(X=2 and Y=2) +
				P(X=3 and Y=3).

Since P(X=x) and P(Y=y) are non-zero for any x,y elements of {1,2,3}, it follows that P(V=10)
!= 0 and P(W=0) != 0.

But: P(V=10 and W=0) = 0

Since when V=10 we cannot have W=0, and so P(v=10 and W=0) != P(V=10)P(W=0)

(i.e.) V and W are not independent.


(b)
Compute the PMF of V, E[V] and var(V).
The pair (X,Y) has sample space S = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),...,(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)}
|S| = 9.
For each of these possible pairs of values (X,Y), the value of V = 2(X+Y) is as follows:

	X=1	X=2	X=3
Y=1	4	6	8
Y=2	6	8	10
Y=3	8	10	12

and so V has sample space {4,6,8,10,12}.
Since X and Y are uniformly distributed, each pairs of values (X,Y) has the same probability:
1/|S| = 1/9.

Therefore:
P(V=4) =1/9, 
P(V=6) =2/9, 
P(V=8) =3/9,
P(V=10)=2/9,
P(V=12)=1/9.


The expectation E[V] is:
E[V] = 5*P(V=4) + 6*P(V=6) + 8*P(V=8) + 10*P(V=10) + 12*P(V=12)
     = 4*(1/9) + 6*(2/9) + 8*(3/9) + 10*(2/9) + 12*(1/9)
     = 8.

The variance is:
var(V) = E[V^2] - E[V]^2
not sure how below is calculated..
var(V) = (4-8)^2*(1/9) + (6-8)^2*(2/9) + (10-8)^2*(2/9) + (12-8)^2*(1/9)
       = (16/3).


(c)
Compute the joint PMF of V and W.
For each pair of value pairs of values (X,Y), the value pair(V,W) is:

	X=1	X=2	X=3
Y=1     (4,0)	(6,1)	(8,2)
Y=2	(6,-1)	(8,0)	(10,1)
Y=3	(8,-2)	(10,-1)	(12,0)

Each pair of values (X,Y) has the same probability 1/9 and the value of (V,W) is different
for each value of (X,Y), so the probability of each of the pairs of values (V,W) in the above
table is 1/9. The probability of other pairs of values is zero.


(d)
Compute E[V|W > 0]
Outcomes where W > 0:
{(6,1), (8,2), (10,1)}

And so,
P(V=6|W>0) = 1/3
P(V=8|W>0) = 1/3
P(V=10|W>0) = 1/3

Therefore:
E[V|W>0] = 6*P(V=6|W>0) + 
	   8*P(V=8|W>0) +
	   10*P(V=10|W>0).

	 = 6*(1/3) +
	   8*(1/3) + 
	   10*(1/3)
	
	 = (24/3)
	
	 = 8.
