QUESTIONS 1:

Two random variables X and Y take values {1,2,...,n}.

Give definition of conditional probability P(Y=y|X=x).
P(Y=y|X=x) = P(Y=y and X=x) / P(X=x)

Prove the marginilization property that P(X=x) = sumof{n}{i=1} P(X=x and Y=i)
sumof{n}{i=1} P(X=x and Y=i) = sumof{n}{i=1} P(Y=i|X=x)P(X=x) = P(X=x)

Using marginilization property above, prove that sumof{n}{i=1} P(Y=i|X=x) = 1
sumof{n}{i=1} P(Y=i|X=x) = 1
(sumof{n}{i=1} P(Y=i and X=x)) / P(X=x) = 1
P(X=x)/P(X=x) = 1
1 = 1

Bag of insects:
	10 crickets
	5 spiders
Draw two insects without replacement..
Given the second insect was a spider, what is the probability that the first insect was also
a spider..?

Let random variable:
	X1=1 if we draw a spider first, and 0 otherwise. 
	X2=1 if we draw a spider second, and  0 otherwise.

P(X1=1|X2=1) = P(X1=1 and X2=1)/P(X2=1) = 0.2856
P(X1=1 and X2=1) = 5/15 * 4/14 = 0.0952
P(X2=1) = P(X2=1 and X1=1) + P(X2=1 and X1=0) = 5/15 * 4/14 + 10/15 * 5/14 = 0.3333





QUESTION 2:

Bayes Rule: P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E) / P(F)

48% support candidate T..
52% support candidate C..
75% supporters of T answered truthfully..
25% supporters of T lied..
100% supporters of C answered truthfully..
Suppose a person answers that they support candidate C..
Probability that they actually support candidate T..?

P(E|F).. Supports T given they answered C..
P(F|E).. Answered C given they support T..(0.25)
P(E).. Supports T..(0.48)
P(F).. Answered C..
P(F) = P(F|E)P(E) + P(F|Ec)P(Ec)
P(F|Ec).. Answered C given they support C..(1)
P(Ec).. Supports C..(0.52)

P(E|F) = (0.25*0.48) / ((0.25*0.48) + (1*0.52)) = 0.1875





QUESTION 3:

5 people play odd-man-out..
Each person flips a coin..
If one coin is different to all others, that person pays.. (1H 4T)
Else everyone flips again..

Probability that one person's coint comes up different to all others?
Outcomes = 2^5 = 32
Out of this we have 10 possibilities that one is different than the rest.. {(H,T,T,T,T),
(T,H,T,T,T),...,(T,H,H,H,H),(H,T,H,H,H)..etc}
10/32 = 0.3125

Define the expectation of a random variable..
E[X] = sumof{n}{i=1} xi*P(X=xi)

Expected number of times they must flip before they know who should pay?
let random variable X be the number of rounds in the game..
E[X] = 1*0.3125+2*(1-0.3125)+3*(1-0.3125)^2+...

Write a matlab simulation of this game that ouptus the number of flips made..
p = 0.3125
count = 1
while (randp > p), count=count+1; end
disp(count)
