QUESTION 1:

We roll a red die and a green die..

Sample space: 6^2 = 36.. assuming both dice have 6 sides.. {(1,1),(1,2),...,(6,6)}


Probability that number on green die is larger than number on red die..?
if we roll 1 on green we have 0 chance of being larger than number on red..
if we roll 2 we have 1/6 chance of being larger than number on red.. 
3 we have 2/6
4 we have 3/6
5 we have 4/6
6 we have 5/6
0 + (1/6) + (2/6) + (3/6) + (4/6) + (5/6) = (15/6) / 6 = 0.41666


Define what it means for two event E and F to be independent..
Event E and F are indepenent if event E taking place does not affect the probability of 
event F taking place and vice versa.. P(E n F) = P(E)P(F)


Let event E be that the sum of the dice equals 2 or 3.. 
Let event F be that the sum of the dice equals 3..
Are E and F independent? Explain with reference to definition above.
E and F are not independent since event E taking place has an affect on the probability that event F will take place. 

E = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}
F = {(1,2),(2,1)}
P(E) = 3/36 = 1/12
P(F) = 2/36 = 1/18
P(E n F) = P({(1,2),(2,1)}) = 1/18
P(E)P(F) = 1/12 * 1/18 = 0.0046
P(E n F) \= P(E)P(F) therefore events are not independent..





QUESTION 2:

Bayes Rule: P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E) / P(F)

1% of computers infected with a virus..
Test gives possitive result 90% of the time with virus..
Test gives negative result 99% of the time without virus..
Suppose the test is possitive for a computer..
Probability that the computer has the virus..?

P(E|F) = Prob. of having virus given tested positive..
P(F|E) = Prob. of testing positive given having virus..(0.9)
P(E) = Prob. of having virus..(0.01)
P(F) = Prob. of testing positive..
P(F) = P(F|E)P(E) + P(F|Ec)P(Ec)
P(F|Ec) = Prob. testing positive given no virus..(1-0.99=0.01)
P(Ec) = Prob. of not having the virus.. (1-0.01=0.99)

P(E|F) = ((0.9)*(0.0.01)) / ((0.9)*(0.0.01)) + ((0.01)*(0.99)) = 0.476





QUESTION 3:

Player bets 1 euro..
roll two dice.. 
if sum is 7, player wins k euro..
else lose their 1 euro..

Define expectation and variance of a discrete random variable:
For random variable X taking values x1,...,xn, the expected value is E[X] = x1*P(X=x1)+...+
xn*P(X=xn).
The variance is Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2


What is the expected reward in this game?
First lets see what the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is..
{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)}.. 6/36 chance of getting a sum of 7.
E[X] = (30/36 * -1) + (6/36 * k)
E[X] = -30/36 + 6k/36


What value of k will make the game fair..?
6k/36 - 30/36 = 0
6k/36 = 30/36
6k = (30/36)*36
k = 30/6
k = 5.
Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
E[X^2] = (30/36 * -1^2) + (6/36 * 5^2) = 5
E[X]^2 = 0^2 = 0
Var(X) = 5 - 0 = 5.


For two independent random variables X and Y, show that Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)..
not sure how to do this..


Suppose you play the game 2 times in a row with k = 5..
What is the expected value of the reward..?
Let X be the reward the first time the game is played and Y the reward the second time 
it is played..
E[X+Y] = E[X]+E[Y] = 0 + 0 = 0.
Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y) = 5 + 5 = 10.
After 100 plays the reward is still expected to be 0 bu the variance is 500.
