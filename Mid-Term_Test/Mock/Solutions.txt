QUESTION 1:

Sample Space:
The set of all possible outcomes or results of an experiment.

Indicator Random Variable: 
Take value 1 if event E occurs and 0 if event E doesn't occur.

Probability Mass Function:  
A function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to 
some value. 

Conditional Probability of an Event:
The probability that event E occurs *given* that event F has already occurred. P(E|F).
P(E|F) = P(E n F) / P(F)

Bayes Theorem:
P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E) / P(F)
P(E).. chance of rain tomorrow, with no extra info.
P(F|E).. probability of a cloudy day before rain
P(E|F).. updated probability of rain tomorrow after observing clouds today
P(F).. chance of a cloudy day, with no extra info. 

Marginalization:
Refers to "summing out" the probability of a random variable X given the joint probability
distribution of X with other variables.
Roll two coins.. what is the probability the the first coin is heads?
Event E is first coint heads..
Event F1 is second coin heads..
Event F2 is second coin tails..
P(E) = P(E n F1) + P(E n F2) = (0.5*0.5) + (0.5*0.5) = 0.5
