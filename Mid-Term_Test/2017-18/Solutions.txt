QUESTION 1:

Solve for x..
-5x+20=25
-5x=5
x=-1

solve for x..
5(2x+1)+3=10
10x+5+3=10
10x=2
x=0.2

solve for x and y..
x-y=0 and x+y=1
x=0.5 and y=0.5

is the following equation true..?
x/2 + y/2 + z/2 = (x+y+z)/2
yes..
10/2 + 20/2 + 30/2 = (10+20+30)/2
30 = 30

Simplify..
(xy+xz)/x
y+z

Define the term random variables and give an example..
A random variable maps from the sample space of random experiment to a real number.. 
(e.g.) X may take value 1 when a coin comes up heads and value 0 if coin comes up tails..

What is the probability mass fucntion of a discrete random variable..?
A function that defined the probabability that random variable X will be exactly equal to a certain value.. (e.g.) chance X will take on value 1 is 0.5 for coin toss..

let X and Y be independent random variables..
takes values in the set {-1,0,1}..
X and Y are uniformly distributed on {-1,0,1}..(prob. of each value occuring is the same)
let V = 2X+2Y
calculate E[X] and E[Y].
E[X] = -1*(0.333) + 0*(0.333) + 1*(0.333) = 0
E[Y] = E[X]
E[V] = 0

What does it mean for two random variables to be independent..?
Two random variables are independent if P(X=x and Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y) for all x and y..

Are V and X independent..?
P(V n X) = P(V)P(X)
They are not independent..
P(X=-1 and V=4) = P(V=4|X=-1)P(X=-1)=0 and P(X=-1)=1/3 and P(V=4)=P(X=1 and Y=1)=1/9
So P(X=-1 and V=4)=- is not equal to P(X=-1)P(V=4)=1/3*1/9..





QUESTION 2:

Conditional probability of a random event..
P(E|F)=P(E n F) / P(F)

Bayes rule:
P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E) / P(F)

2 websites A and B..
A takes 60% of all bookings..
B takes 40%..
75% of bookings made on A results in positive reviews..
90% of bookings made on B results in positive reviews..
Given a booking received a posistive review, probability that booking was made on site B..

P(E|F).. booking made on B given positive review..
P(F|E).. positive review given booking made on B..(0.9)
P(E).. booking made on B..(0.4)
P(F).. positive review..
P(F) = P(F|E)P(E) + P(F|Ec)P(Ec)
P(F|Ec) = possitive review given booking made on A..(0.75)
P(Ec) = booking made on A..(0.6)

P(E|F) = (0.9*0.4) / ((0.9*0.4) + (0.75*0.6))
P(E|F) = 0.44





question 3:

Data stored accross 10 disks..
to read a file data needs to be successfully ready from any 3 of 10 disks..

A server selects 3 disks independently and uniformly at random..
Prob. that disk 1 is read..?
No. of ways we can select 3 of 10 disks without replacement is 10*9*8 = 720..
suppose disk 1 is the first disk we read..
(1,2,3),(1,2,4),(1,3,5).. etc
basically slot 1 is a constant and the other 2 slots have a choice of 9 slots, and then 8..
so there are 1*9*8=72 combinations for this.. 
What if disk 1 is in the 2nd position.. or 3rd?
Same thing.. so 72*3=216 is total combinations of picking disk 1..
probability of this.. 216/720 = 0.3

Suppose now that disk 1 and 2 cannot be read together..
prob of reading disk 1 now..?
basically we have 1 less variable to work with.. so 1*8*7*3=168..
sample space is different now.. 
reading 1 on its own.. 168
reading 2 on its own.. 168
reading neither.. 8*7*6=336
Sample space = 672..
168/672=0.25

Each disk fails independently with prob. of 0.01..
3 disks need to be read successfully to reconstruct a file..
When server reads 3 disks what is prob that the file fails to be reconstructed..
prob of no disks failing.. (1-0.01)^3
prob one or more failing.. 1- (1-0.01)^3 = 0.03

Prob. when the server now reads 4 disks..?
prob of no disks failing.. (1-0.01)^4
prob of 1 disk failing.. 4*0.01*(1-0.01)^3
prob of none failing + prob of 1 failing = prob of 3 successfully reading.. which is what 
we need.. (1-0.01)^4 + 4*0.01*(1-0.01)^3
1 - this is the chance of it failing.. 
1 - (1-0.01)^4 + 4*0.01*(1-0.01)^3 = 0.0006
