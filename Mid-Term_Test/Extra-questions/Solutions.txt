QUESTION 1:

String of n bits sent accross a lossy link. How many ways can 2 bit errors occur when n = 3?
(3 choose 2) = 3

How many ways can letters MISSISSIPPI be rearranged?
1 M, 4 I, 4 S, 2 P.
11! / (4!4!2!) = 34650
or..
(11 choose 4) * (7 choose 4) * (3 choose 2) = 34650

Straight flush consists of 5 cards in order, all of the same suit.. (eg) 2,3,4,5,6 of clubs
How many straight flushes are possible?
I guess we can work out how many possible flushes of one suit, and then just multiply by 4..
{(2,3,4,5,6), (3,4,5,6,7), (4,5,6,7,8)...(10,J,Q,K,A)} would be set of flushes..
10 elements in this set, multiplied by 4 is 40.




QUESTION 2:

Six people in an elevator at ground floor..
10 upper floors..
Each person gets off at a floor uniformly at random..
Probability that no two people get off at the same floor?

Basically, let each of these six people represent a number, whats the probability that no two
of those numbers are the same..
10*9*8*7*6*5 = 151200 / 10^6 = 0.1512




QUESTION 3:

Random variable X has P(X=x)=x/15 for x=1,2,3,4,5
P(X=x) = 0 for all other values. 

What is the mean and variance of X?

mean is also referred to as the Expected value of a random variable..
E[X] = sumof{n}{i=1} xi*P(X=xi)

E[X] = 1*1/15 + 2*2/15 + 3*3/15 + 4*4/15 + 5*5/15 = 3.6667

Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2..
E[X^2] = (1^2)*1/15 + (2^2)*2/15 + (3^2)*3/15 + (4^2)*4/15 + (5^2)*5/15 = 15 
E[X]^2 = 3.6667^2 = 13.446889
Var(X) = 15 - 13.446889 = 1.554111


You take a 6-sided die and roll it
If you roll 6, stop, else repeat..

What is the distribution of the number of times you roll the die?
Is this the same as probability of rolling 6 on the n-th roll..?
If so solution is P(X=n) = (5/6)^(n-1) * (1/6)

What is the expected number of rolls?
E[X] = (1/6)*1 + (5/6)(1/6)*2 + (5/6)^2(1/6)*3.. etc
